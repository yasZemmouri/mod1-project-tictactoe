You start by putting X on a square on the board. Then another player or the computer put O in the different square. The player who can can have 3 Xs or 3 Os in a row on column or diagonal win the round.
Once the round over the player can continue playing by reset the board and continue playing by clicking anywhere inside the screen. The score keeps incrementing at every round.
The player can switch its oppenent at avery moment in the game.
The player can sollicite a suggestion move at any time in the game.

**Approch Taken**
My logic is based on procedural programming. It consiste of a set of global variables and independant functions that perform specific operations and call other functions or mutate global variables.

**Insolved Problems**
I copy pasted some of the code instead of using more functins.
I relayed to much on global variables.
